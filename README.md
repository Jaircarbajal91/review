# JavaScript Review

Hello! Thanks for stopping by and checking out this JS review repo!

If you love to code and are leveling up your skillset than you're in the right place! 🤘🏼

I will be speed running through the JavaScript Beginner Bootcamp Udemy course. Check it out here if you're interested, [JavaScript Beginner Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-the-basics-for-beginners/).

Learning to code is hard enough and learning alone adds another level of complexity, so feel free to reach out on GitHub!

Lets go!
