/** CONST
  Declaring const will create a value that is a read-only reference. It can be either global or local to the function or block in which it is declared as you can't change the reference or literal that is assigned to it.

  We would want to use const when we wouldn't want to alter the value of our variable. Something like an API key should be declared using const so that other code will not alter the value.
