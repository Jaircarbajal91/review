## Key notes about functions

- There are 3 main ways to declare funcitons in JS. Anonymous, declared, and IIFE. There is also arrow functions, shorthand method definition (functions defined in an object that don't have `function` keyword, generator functions (generator function in JavaScript returns a Generator object), and new Function).

- For simplicity sake, we looked at declared functions. A declared function only uses the `function` keyword unlike an expression that uses `var, let, const`.
